  The storage/app/public directory may be used to store user-generated files,
  such as profile avatars, that should be publicly accessible.
  You should create a symbolic link at public/storage which points to this directory.

Instead of making a symlink as usual, I've made one with a *relative* path so that
the link is unaffected by changing the project root directory.

Once pulled from git, this folder should have a ".gitignore" file containing:
  *
  !.gitignore
