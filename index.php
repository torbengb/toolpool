    <h2>Welcome to your TOOL||POOL!</h2>

    <p>This prototype is <span style="background-color: yellow"><a href="http://dev.toolpool.club">in development</a>.</span>

    <p>This prototype is <span style="background-color: yellow">a community platform for people to share their tools for
        DIY home-improvement projects.</span>

    <h3>TOOL||POOL helps people to find tools they can borrow, rather than buying them.</h3>

    <p>Imagine this:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>You need a tool that you don't have,</b> let's say a nail gun for a fence, or a tile cutter. Do you
            really want to go out and buy one, just for this one use? It's expensive and you will probably not need it
            again for a long time, if ever.
        <li><b>A guy down the road has the tool in his garage.</b> He almost never uses it. He is a member of the
            TOOL||POOL community, and you find his tool offered here on the site. You request to borrow the tool, and he
            says you can pick it up today after work and return it in a week!
        <li><b>You're happy</b> that you didn't have to buy an expensive tool, <b>and he's happy</b> that his tool
            doesn't just collect dust.
    </ol>

    <p>TOOL||POOL helps people build a positive neighborhood. <span style="background-color: yellow">TOOL||POOL is a volunteer community: there are no fees, no
        subscriptions, no payments.</span> You just need to supply your own nails, blades, oil, and other consumables. Don't
        fret about the risk of borrowing your precious tools to strangers&mdash;instead, see it as an opportunity to
        meet new like-minded DIY enthusiasts in your neighborhood!
